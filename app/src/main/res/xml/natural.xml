Hair tends to loose its natural color and turn grey with advancing age. However, premature graying of hair is a sinister condition that makes even the young look old.

Hair is made up of epidermis, the same cells which are found in the outer layers of skin. Hair rises from hair follicles which lie in the inner layer of epidermis. Sebaceous glands in the scalp secrete sebum which nourishes hair and renders luster and black color to our hair. Sebaceous glands in turn get their nourishment from the main blood stream.

<img class="alignright" title="causes premature hair graying " src="http://home-cure.net/images/prematurehairgraying.JPG" alt="premature hair graying " width="350" height="350" />
As such, premature graying of hair can be attributed to deficiencies of essential nutrients in the blood stream or defects in the sebaceous glands.

<strong>Causes of premature graying of hair:</strong>  Premature graying of hair primarily results from either an unbalanced diet intake or mental worrying.

<strong>Causes of measles: </strong>Measles is caused by a virus and is easily transmitted in the early stages through droplets of moisture discharged through coughs and sneezing by the patient. The virus attacks people with weak immunity which could result from malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency, unhygienic living conditions and bad food habits.

<strong>Symptoms of measles:</strong> The first symptom of measles may appear in seven to fourteen days after virus infection. The rashes may be of small round spots on the skin, which may be of pink
color initially and they grow to dark red in color as times passes. These rashes initially appear on the sides of the face and the neck, gradually spreading all over the body.

Other allied symptoms of measles include high fever during this period, which may rise to 104 degrees in acute cases, running nose, sore throat, continuous dry cough, redness and watering of the eyes, loss of appetite and
diarrhea or vomiting and delirium in severe cases.

<strong>Steps to follow for treatment and prevention of measles</strong>

If the characteristic signs of measles occur in your child, the first thing to do is see your doctor. Consulting a physician helps to alleviate symptoms of the disease and to avoid potential complications.

Measles is a disease that the body will fight on its own and it will be cured in some time. There are no drugs that can fight the virus, so the only useful treatments are those that help relieve symptoms. But doctors generally prescribe medicines to cure sore throat or cough, antibiotics to curb bacterial infection, analgesics to reduce fever and Vitamin A supplements to reduce the risk of brain infection.

Failure to take preventive measures can result in serious complications like dehydration, respiratory infections (like pneumonia), ear infection and even encephalitis in worst cases.

<strong>Bed rest</strong>: Rest is highly recommended to the patient with measles. The child must then drink plenty of water and eat properly.

        <content><![CDATA[<strong>Archive of best Home Cure for Urinary Tract Infection. Holistic 4 pronged strategy to cure UTI with natural remedies and lifestyle changes.</strong>

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is microbial infection of the urinary tract which is generally caused by of Escherichi coli (in around 80% of cases). UTI is characterized by a tendency to urinate frequently. Variants of UTI include acute laburnum (infection of urinary bladder) and pyelonephritis (infection of upper urinary tract which may extend upto the kidney)

Other bacteria that generally infect the urinary tract include Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella .

UTI can effect either sexes. However it is more common in women because of lack bacteriostatic properties in their urinary tract. UTI can happen at any age, but elder people are more vulnerable to UTI because of their weakened immune system.

Urine has acidic properties (pH of 5) which are not favorable for growth of bacteria. Additionally urination expels microbes from the urinary tract and prevents it from rising to the bladder and kidneys; Men are further protected from UTI as their prostatic secretions have vital anti bacterial properties.

Thus the body has natural defenses against bacterial infection of the urinary tract.<strong></strong>In Case of UTI, the natural defenses of the body fail and bacteria colonize the urinary tract

Additionally, in case of kidney infection (pyelonephritis), the patient may feel severe pain in abdomen, lower back, or genitals which can be accompanied by high fever and/or chills. Nausea or vomiting are other allied symptoms of pyelonephritis.
<h2><strong>Drawbacks of Allopathic Cures for UTI</strong></h2>
Doctors generally prescribe antibiotics to directly attack harmful bacteria that infect the urinary tract. They also prescribe diuretic medicines, which induce copious urination. This helps to flush out harmful bacteria from the urinary tract.

This however does not address the root cause as to why the infection occurred in the first place. It is for this reason that round 30% of UTI patients witness a relapse of infection within one month of their first infection.

Additionally, diuretic medicines are not without unwanted side effects.
<h2>Natural Home Cure for Urinary tract infection – a holistic approach</h2>
Natural diuretics are a safer alternative to diuretic medicines as they have not side effects. (consult doctor before replacing prescribed medications with natural alternatives)

<img src="http://home-cure.net/images/homecureuti.JPG" alt="" width="342" height="274" align="left" border="0" />

<strong>III) Vitamin E: </strong>Vitamin E prevents toxic radicals from disrupting cellular activities. This prevents bacteria from thriving in the urinary tract. This can be combined with supplements of Zinc and Selenium to strengthen body immunity.

<h2><strong>STEP 2: KILL BACTERIA WITH NATURAL ANTIBIOTICS</strong></h2>
<strong><img src="http://home-cure.net/images/horseradish.jpg" alt="" width="139" height="75" align="right" border="0" />III) Horseradish</strong> <strong>root </strong>(Botanical name: Armoracia rusticana): Horseradish has vital antibiotic properties suitable for treatment of UTI.

Drinking water promotes urination and helps flush out harmful bacteria from the infected urinary tracts.

Water intake should be evenly distributed over the day. Intake of excess water in short period of time can cause hyper hydration or water poisoning A good thumb rule is to drink at least two glasses of water every 2 hours when you are awake.

A diet comprising of moderate intake of these natural products assists in flushing harmful bacteria from the urinary tract.
<h2><strong>STEP 4 LIFESTYLE CHANGES</strong></h2>
Poor hygiene is one of the prime causes of UTI. Cleanliness is of utmost importance for preventing bacterial infections in urinary tract. The following are

recommended:

<strong>XI) Wash lower body parts:</strong> Keeping the lower body parts clean is the best preventive measure against UTI. Wash your genitals (vulva and anal areas) daily, especially before sexual intercourse. However there is no need to get too aggressive with this cleanliness regime. Excessive cleaning can weaken the mucous membranes and can do more harm than good in case of UTI. Thoroughly wipe the anal areas and vulva with toilet paper after after urinating or excreting.

<strong>XII) Moderation in sexual activities</strong><strong>: </strong>Sexual intercourse destroys the membrane lining in the urinary tract. Excessive sexual activities does not give enough time for

regeneration of the urinary tract membrane making it vulnerable to bacterial attacks. Clean the genital areas before and after sexual intercourse. Urinating shortly after sex cleans the urinary tract of possible infections and is effective preventive measure against UTI. In case of vaginal dryness, use water-soluble lubricants during sex to avoid damaging the urinary tract membranes.

<strong>XIII) Enjoy a massage</strong>: An regular external massage of bladder area helps in reducing inflammation caused by bacterial infection. Massaging the bladder area externally with oil comprising of sandalwood, juniper, bergamot, tea tree and incense provides provides relief from several symptoms of UTI.

<strong>XIV) Rethink those pills: </strong>Many contraceptive pills tend to reduce natural body immunity and can cause UTI. UTI sufferers should consider using other family planning products like condoms.

<strong>XV) Other recommendations: </strong>

Avoid using deodorants, oils or bath foams in the genital area as they irritate urethra lining resulting in UTI.

Fruits and vegetables contain soluble fiber of the water which naturally flush your urinary system. A liberal intake of fruits is a beneficial in treatment of UTI.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

A timely remedy for UTI is very important as prolonged UTI can lead to other diseases like cystitis, polynephritis, gonorrhea or chlamydia.

Malaria is widespread in tropical and sub tropical regions of the world, where the anopheles mosquitoes thrive.

<strong>Agents of Malaria: </strong>Round 80% of malaria is caused by a parasite called Plasmodium falciparum which has a lifespan of 2 months. Other less common agents of malaria include Plasmodium vivax: ( 3 years, but less serious), Plasmodium Ovale: (3 years) and Plasmodium Malariae which is rare and mild form of malaria with a life span of 10 years or more. Variants of malaria include tertian fever, quartan fever and malignant tertian fever.

<strong>Malaria Incubation period: </strong>Malaria generally lasts for round 8 to 20 days (max 2 months) after the bite of incubation. This period is characterized by febrile seizures every 2 -4 days. Malarial infection is also characterized by swings between apparent recovery and worsening of conditions.

        <title>Temporomandibular Joint- TMJ</title>
        <link>http://home-cure.net/home-remedies-exercises-natural-cures-tmj-treatment/</link>
        <guid>477</guid>
        <content><![CDATA[<strong>Holistic Home remedies and natural cures for treatment of Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) pain and its allied symptoms</strong>

The mandible is<strong> </strong>the toughest and biggest bone of the face and it serves to support the lower teeth. The joints of the mandible are the only joints in the body which move on a hard tissue.

When the jaw is misaligned as a result of trauma, malocclusion (bad bite) or otherwise, it is known as temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ).
<h2>Symptoms of TMJ</h2>
<strong><img src="http://home-cure.net/images/tmjpain.jpg" alt="" width="138" height="207" align="left" border="0" />1) Circular Headache: </strong>One of the most common symptoms of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a headache similar to one that would be felt when a cloth would be tightly tied on the head for a long period of time. Many people who suffer from a headache due to TMJ describe it as a ring of pain around the head. The pain increases every time a TMJ sufferer speaks or grinds his teeth.
The constant contraction of the muscles of the mandibles creates a stress and strain in the face, head and neck. This muscular contraction reduces the amount of blood in the head. The body responds by sending more blood this region which increases the blood pressure in the head region which gives a headache.

<strong>2) D</strong><strong>epression</strong><strong> and anxiety: </strong>Any pain can be frustrating and when it’s a chronic pain, refusing to die, depression and anxiety are but natural. Depression usually occurs when patients can not get relief from the pain because of poor diagnosis of symptoms.
<h2>Causes of TMJ</h2>
TMJ is primarily caused by:
<img src="http://home-cure.net/images/temporomandibularjoint.jpg" alt="" width="198" height="190" align="right" border="0" />
<ul>
	<li>External Trauma like a blow on the jaws due to accidents or otherwise.</li>
	<li>Internal trauma: from excessive chewing, teeth clenching or grinding (Bruxism)</li>
	<li>Mental trauma, stress or anxiety</li>
	<li>Osteoarthritis: depletion of cartilage and no formation of new bone due to aging</li>
	<li>Rheumatoid Arthritis</li>
	<li>Birth defect - Muscular alignment issues</li>
	<li>Nutritional deficiencies (especially of Calcium and Magnesium)</li>
	<li>Spinal alignment issues</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Allopathic cure for TMJ</strong></h2>
In many cases of TMJ , it has been found that doctors often keep looking for local causes of pain and fail to diagnose the exact cause. The result - patient often fail to respond to treatment, whereby the frustration, and anxiety increases.

For an effective cure, it is important to correctly diagnose the cause. Once diagnosed, proper treatment can provide psychological and physical relief.

Pain caused by muscular contraction can be temporarily relieved with medication, exercises or psychological therapy. But the root cause of disease (i;e malocclusion dislocation) still persists.

Alternatively doctors prescribe surgery of blood vessels in the brain to realign temporomandibular joints in an optimal position. This neuromuscular dentistry surgery mostly provides relief from chronic pain.

However, surgery is expensive and not without post-surgical complications.

hyper hydration or water poisoning A good thumb rule is to drink at least two glasses of water every 2 hours during the day time.

<strong>Nutrition plays a vital role in alleviating TMJ pain.</strong> In a study conducted on 280 TMJ sufferers, it was found that round 249 had a nutritional deficiency of calcium and magnesium.

Another study conducted by International Dental Association on 50 TMJ sufferer shows that adding calcium and magnesium supplements to food provided relief from TMJ pain to 70% of the participants.

Calcium provides strength to the bones while magnesium relives muscular tension.

An average adult requires a daily magnesium intake of 310mg. Normal staple food often fails to supply this quantity. A deficiency in magnesium can lead to muscle spasms, Magnesium also helps in calcium metabolism which help prevent other TMJ related diseases like osteoporosis.

<strong>What is Hypoglycemia?</strong> Hypoglycemia or low blood sugar is a disorder of blood sugar metabolism. This condition arises when there is fall in glucose levels in the blood to less than 3.5 millimoles per liter (mmol / l).

The glucose level, which determines the energetic nature of the body, is found in the fruits, rice, cereals and milk and other dairy products, which contain sugar. The food that one eats is absorbed in the blood as glucose. Glucose is converted to energy by insulin which helps the body to stay active and healthy.

Hypoglycemia is characterized by loss of energy accompanied by nervousness, tremor, a compelling hunger and other symptoms. The discomforts disappear as the patient intakes sugar.

<strong>Symptoms of Hypoglycemia: </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Sudden loss of energy, state of weakness</li>
	<li>Hunger and craving for sweets, since the body lacks the essential levels of sugar</li>

	<li>Disturbed vision and headaches</li>
</ul>
Some may have symptoms like, sweating, trembling, pale face, headache, compelling hunger, drowsiness, absentmindedness, numbness, weakness, dizziness and palpitations of the heart.

<strong>Causes of Hypoglycemia:</strong> Hypoglycemia is usually diagnosed in people with impaired glucose tolerance (common in early stage of diabetes), diabetes or some sort of pancreatic disorder.

Excessive consumption of refined foods is a cause for low blood sugar. Lack of nutrients in such foods makes the pancreas; adrenal glands lose their ability to handle blood sugar.

Other causes of low blood sugar may include tumors, disturbed liver, disturbed adrenal gland functions and stress.

<strong>Archive of best home remedies and natural cures for tinnituts. Tinnitus treatment at home with alternative home remedies</strong>

Tinnitus (Hyperacusis) is characterized by ringing and other unpleasant noises in the ears. The sound may be constant or intermittent and can vary widely, from mild ringing to loud buzzing sounds in the ear. In extreme cases, tinnitus can have drastic effects on the patient's sleep and concentration.
<h2>Causes of Tinnitus</h2>
The exact causes of tinnitus may vary from person to person. There are multiple
hypotheses that try to explain this phenomena. Some of the possible causes of tinnitus include:

<strong>Defects of the auditory system: </strong>

Tinnitus noises (ringing, buzzing) that originate in the ear are most often caused by
defects in the auditory system. Some common defects include:
<ul>
	<li>Pressure differences in the cavities of the inner ear.</li>
	<li>Lesions of the inner ear and nerve endings</li>
	<li>Nervous imbalance of the jaw or spine, hyperacusis</li>
	<li>Inflammatory, circulatory or muscular tension</li>
	<li>Imbalances of the Jaw and teeth (malocclusion, TMJ, bruxism, SADAM)</li>
	<li>Imbalances of the cervical vertebrae</li>
	<li>Damage to the auditory nerve caused by normal aging</li>
	<li>Invasion of inner ear by external particles</li>
</ul>
Another possible defect involves excess secretion of glutamate in the ears.Glutamate is a chemical released by the auditory hair cells which causes toxic microscopic lesions in the tissue. This results in hyperactivity of the auditory nerve which tends to amplify all sounds which would otherwise be inaudible.

<strong>Physiological origin</strong><strong> :</strong> Ringing in ears is caused by physiological factors like traumatic shock caused to the ears by sudden loud noises, consistent noise pollution, stress, nervous tension, fatigue, low or high blood pressure, digestive disorders, constipation, sleep disorders, deprivation, muscle inflammation, neck injury, head injuries, circulatory disorders, kidney disorders (diabetes), liver disorders or intoxication. As per this school of thought, these physiological imbalances induce an impairment of the auditory system and result in tinnitus

<strong>Neurological origin</strong> : As per this school, tinnitus has a strong neuronal origin. In response to sudden excessive noise or in reaction to stress, the brain attaches an exaggerated importance to the background noise and lesser importance to the loud noise, in order to protect the auditory system from damages. This receptiveness of the brain tends to linger for a longer time. Researchers have also found that many tinnitus patients show an abnormal excitation of neurons in the auditory cortex area of the brain.

Excessive amounts of stress can interfere with normal body chemistry and may cause tinnitus.
<h2>Home remedies and Natural Cure of Tinnitus</h2>
<img src="http://home-cure.net/images/earbuds.jpg" alt="" width="71" height="82" align="left" border="0" />As with any other disorder, cure for tinnitus begins with correct diagnosis of the underlying cause.If for instance tinnitus is caused by obstruction or presence of foreign particles, a simple cleaning of ears may be sufficient to relieve symptoms of tinnitus. If tinnitus is caused due to physiological defects, it may require certain cardio logical exercises or scalpel
intervention to get rid of tinnitus.

If tinnitus has a psychological origin, tinnitus treatment would involve a psychological intervention. Tinnitus with neurological origin cannot be treated on-the-go as brain needs some time to restore its receptiveness to normal.

If diabetes or high blood pressure is the cause of tinnitus, treatment must be aimed at curbing or regulating the disease.

However, not every one is fortunate enough to diagnose the exact cause of tinnitus. In many cases, tinnitus can be triggered by multiple co-existing factors. It is therefore
advised to try out a combination of home remedies for tinnitus.

A <strong>holistic Tinnitus treatment </strong>requires a three pronged attack involving:
<ul>
	<li>Dietary /lifestyle changes to address nutritional deficiencies that causes Tinnitus</li>
	<li>Exercises to rectify any possible physical cause of tinnitus</li>
	<li>Relaxation exercises to rectify any possible neurological cause of tinnitus.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2>1) Food to naturally cure tinnitus</h2>
Some foods may have the effect of increasing the intensity of tinnitus while others help alleviate the symptoms of tinnitus.

Adopting good and healthy eating habits helps address those nutritional deficiencies that cause tinnitus. Adequate intake of protein, vitamins A, E, B, zinc and chlorine are of particular importance in combating tinnitus.

In general the following foods have been found to be effective in alleviating symptoms of tinnitus.

<h2>Tinnitus: Foods to avoid</h2>
<strong>1) Reduce Salt Intake</strong>: Excess salt is known to promote water retention in the body. This increases blood flow to the ears and creates pressure on the auditory system. This is known to aggravate ringing in the ears. On the contrary, reducing salt intake helps is reducing intensity of tinnitus.

<strong>2)Avoid Fats:</strong> Avoid or eliminate foods that increase cholesterol. Food like fatty meats, egg yolks, sausages, butter, oil or margarine based hydrogenated oil. Replace it with oils rich in omega-6, linoleic acid and other unsaturated fats.

<strong>3) Identify and avoid allergens</strong><strong>:</strong> Allergies to certain foods can cause tinnitus. Food like avocado, chocolate, milk, cheese, soybeans, ripe bananas and some citrus fruits are common allergens that cause tinnitus. Notice your food which resulted in worsening of symptoms and avoid them.

<strong>4) Avoid Stimulants</strong><strong>:</strong> Stimulants like alcohol, tea, coffee and cigarettes exacerbate the sensitivity of auditory nerves resulting in increased sensitivity and ringing of ears.

&nbsp;
<h2>2) EXERCISES FOR TINNITUS</h2>
Atherosclerosis and hypertension are two most common causes of tinnitus. Researches have proved that regular cardiovascular exercise decreases the intensity of tinnitus. A list of exercises beneficial in tinnitus are listed hereunder. In general any exercise that gets blood pumping is beneficial in treatment of tinnitus

<strong>Tinnitus exercise #1: </strong>Sit upright and bow your head to the front<strong> </strong>so that the chin comes in contact with your chest. Intertwine fingers of your hands and keep it at the back of your head. Pull your head back while letting your intertwined hands oppose this rear movement. Don’t over exert. Repeat this 3-5 times twice a day to relax your entire spinal chord. This exercise is a very effective home remedy for tinnitus.

<strong>Tinnitus Exercise #2: </strong>Without exerting too much, open your jaws as wide as possible. With jaws wide open, touch the roof of mouth with the tip of your tongue. Move the tongue tip in backward direction (toward your tonsils), while it touches the roof of the mouth. Hold for few seconds. Next pull your tongue out of your mouth and stretch it the maximum. Hold for few seconds. Repeat 4-5 times.

<strong>Tinnitus Exercise #3 </strong>Sit in an upright posture and move your chin up and down for around 20 times. Stop and then move your chin in a side to side movement for another 20 times. Repeat thrice. Do not stretch too hard or you may sprain your neck.

<strong>Tinnitus</strong><strong> Exercise # 4</strong> Stand facing a mirror. Support your chin with both hands and open your mouth wide. Touch the inside top of your mouth with the tip of your tongue and do a slow up-down movement of your jaws. Provide slight resistance to your moving jaws with your hands. Do this for one minute in each sitting and repeat up to three times a day

<strong>Tinnitus exercises #5: </strong>Sit in an upright position and open your jaws wide but in a relaxed position. Now with mouth wide open, lift your heads to the back to point your brow to the skies. Take deep breath and exhale slowly. Come back to the starting posture and repeat.
<h2>Other recommendations</h2>
Tinnitus patients are often tempted to isolate themselves from the surrounding noise by wearing earplugs. This practice should be discontinued, because although it may provide temporary relief, it ultimately leads to amplify the perception of sounds and thus increase hyperacusis.

Protecting ears with ear plugs or protective shells is advised only in high noise environments.]]></content>

</ul>Stammering is a fairly common problem. As per an estimate; approximately 1.5% of the world population is affected by this speech disorder.<strong> </strong>

<strong><a name="_WhatisStammering"></a>What is Stammering ?</strong>

Stammering is an involuntary interruption or inability to push a syllable or letter while speaking. This difficulty is usually encountered when speaking words beginning with or sounds produced by letters b, d, g, k, p and t. Stammering may also be accompanied by allied symptoms like a red face, tremor of the jaw and blinking of eyes when speaking.

<strong><a name="_Peoplevulnerabletostammerinng"></a>Who are affected ?</strong>

Stammering generally occurs in childhood, between three and seven years and is perfectly acceptable. Stammering becomes a cause of concern, when it extends beyond 10 years of age. Statistically, 1 out of every 4 children who stammer, retain it up to adulthood.

It can affect members of either sex, but is more common in men than women.

<strong><a name="_Implicationsofstammering"></a>Implications of stammering</strong>

Stammering is benign condition with no physical implications. Stammering in childhood (2-5 years) is normal as children develop their speech abilities in this age. This should normally disappear with age.

However, if stammering lasts longer or is left untreated, it has vital social, emotional and psychological implications.

Stammering may result in a significant loss of motivation to speak and induce a person to be silent in friend circle, school or at workplace, for fear of ridicule.

<strong><a name="_Whatcausesstammering"></a>What causes stammering ?</strong> Physiological factors are primarily responsible for stammering in children. Children stammer due to one of the following causes:

1) Inability to control muscles of the organs of speech

2) Obstruction in the organs of speech.

3) Neuromuscular problems

4) Difficulty in the movement of the tongue and lips

However, stammering in advanced age is also attributed to psychological factors like: loss of confidence in ones ability to speak without stammering. Other psychological factors that can ‘trigger’ stammering include scorn, anxiety, arousal and tense family atmosphere.
<h2><strong><a name="_Exercisesforstammering"></a>Exercises for stammering </strong></h2>
<strong></strong>Exercises are effective in treatment of physiological causes of stammering. In general, exercises are meant to provide strength to the organs associated with speech including tongue, lips, jaw, trachea and lungs.

Many people who stammer have found these exercises to be beneficial in reducing the intensity and in some cases, completely curing stammering problem.

The exercises should preferably be done every night in a secluded area, before going to bed. An exercise regimen comprising of the following exercises are beneficial in treatment and cure of stammering.

<img src="http://home-cure.net/images/stammerexercise5.jpg" alt="" width="86" height="63" align="left" border="0" />

<strong>Stammering Exercise #1</strong> Loudly and clearly pronounce the vowels A, E, I, O and U. Be overly articulate and distort your face strongly, every time you utter the vowels.
<img src="http://home-cure.net/images/stammerexercise2.jpg" alt="" width="107" height="112" align="right" border="0" />

<strong>Stammering Exercise #2:</strong> Open your jaws as wide as you can without exerting hard. While the jaws are still open, lift your tongue upwards to touch the roof of mouth with the tip of your tongue. While still in contact with the roof of your mouth, drag the tip of your tongue towards the back of your mouth. When your tongues get stretched to the maximum (without hurting), hold there for few seconds. Next pull out your tongue outside the mouth and stretch it downwards as if attempting to touch the chin. Hold in that position for few seconds. Repeat 4-5 times.

<img src="http://home-cure.net/images/stammerexercise1.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="156" align="left" border="0" />

<strong>Stammering Exercise #3:</strong> Deep breathing exercise are very effective in curing speech disorders like stammering as they help to strengthen the respiratory organs and to relax neuromuscular tension that builds up in the body.

Stammering can be controlled by learning to voluntarily control the rhythm of words by implementation of specific breathing patterns. There can be many variants of deep breathing exercises and one can choose any or all exercises which he/she is comfortable doing. Some of the variants are:

a) Inhale deeply through mouth and exhale slowly, immediately after inhalation.

b)<strong> </strong>Inhale deeply through mouth and push your tongue outside the mouth while exhaling.
c) Inhale deeply through mouth, at the same time, press your chest muscles inward. Exhale slowly

You can have your own variations of these deep breathing exercises, as long as they provide some respiratory motion, swelling of the abdomen and workout for chest and other speech organs. Do not overdo any exercise and bring variations, every one or two minutes.

<img src="http://home-cure.net/images/reading.jpg" alt="" width="141" height="80" align="right" border="0" />

<strong>Stammering Exercise #4:</strong> Reading exercises are helpful in identification of patterns of repetition of syllables that cause stammering and thus reduce bottlenecks of fast reading. For this exercise, take a text and read it fast without laying emphasis on the quality of speech. Speedy reading will help a subconscious identification of each word. Prefer the speed to the quality of speech. Let the words be wrongly spoken and do not stop on any particular word or syllable. This exercise, if continued for 2-3 months is very effective in relaxing muscular tension and correcting all obstructions of the speech.

<strong><img src="http://home-cure.net/images/stammerexercise4.jpg" alt="" width="94" height="73" align="left" border="0" />Stammering Exercise #5 </strong>Singing is a very effective exercise for stammering. Singing helps the sufferer learn to better control breath and the phonatory muscles. Another very effective treatment for stammering involves participation in theatrical activities. Theatre helps shed down several inhibitions and is very effective remedy for stammering.
<h2><strong><a name="_Otherreccomendationsforstoppingstammering"></a>Lifestyle Changes to Treat Stammering </strong></h2>
<strong>Fighting inferiority complex:</strong> Developing confidence in ones own ability to speak correctly is probably the only real solution to cure stammering. However building self-confidence when one makes nervous mistakes in every sentence is not easy. Inferiority complex is natural in people who stammer. Dealing with this complex is the most paramount task in overcoming stammering. Talking openly when the person approaches with the subject is vital in handling this complex. Maintaining a relaxed environment at home gives the child an opportunity to speak without stress.

<strong>Watch out your breath: </strong>As a general thumb rule, one should breathe from the belly and not from the chest. Breathing from the belly naturally calms down and relaxes nervous and muscular tension and is a helpful habit in curing stammering and related disorders.

<strong>Family support: </strong>Family support is of vital importance in treatment of stammering. Family members should use all possible means to deliver the person of his state of anxiety which is the only cause of stammering in a large number of cases. Family members must:
<img src="http://home-cure.net/images/parenting.jpg" alt="" width="156" height="145" align="left" border="0" />
<ul>
	<li>Not punish or react harshly on a person who is stammering</li>
	<li>Listen carefully, when such a person speaks</li>
	<li>Adapt to speak slowly and not interrupt when a person stammers</li>
	<li>Be patient and wait for the person to complete words</li>
	<li>Not complete sentences or words when such a person is trying to speak.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Consulting a speech therapist</strong><strong>: </strong>Speech therapy has been used to cure or reduce the intensity of stammering. Speech therapist try to diagnose the causes of stammering and accordingly prescribe exercises, medications and/or scalpel intervention in certain cases.<strong> </strong>

In case of physiological defects, speech therapy is compulsory to treat stammering. While speech therapist mainly concentrate on speech corrections, they may also adopt psychotherapies like hypnosis, impoco, role plays or cognitive behavioral therapy, if diagnosis suggests a psychological cause for stammering. Many therapist also use acupuncture, yoga spa treatment and other relaxation techniques to assist in treatment of stammering.

Many cities have specialized speech therapy centers which offer intensive cures and therapies for stammering.
<img src="http://home-cure.net/images/hearingdevice.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="112" align="left" border="0" />

<strong>Hearing aid: </strong>There are also some hearing aids that help to reduce or eliminate stammering. The electronic device records the user's voice using a microphone and sends it back to his ears after a delay of about split seconds or at a slightly different frequency.
Simultaneous speaking and the ability to listen to how it is heard by others is very effective in helping one who stammers correct his errors.

Though familiarization with the device may take up to a few months, they often succeed in breaking the psychological barrier that prevents normal speech. Once the barrier is broken and the practitioner gains confidence, he/she can start speaking normally without using the device.
<h2><a name="__Foodforthosewhostammer"></a>Food for those who stammer</h2>
<img src="http://home-cure.net/images/amla.png" alt="" width="94" height="72" align="right" border="0" />

While there are no particular foods that can be used to cure stammering, some food are known to be beneficial for speech organs. For instance, chewing Indian gooseberry, Almonds, Black pepper, Cinnamon and dried dates are known to clear speech congestions. Thus they can be taken internally in moderate quantities to address symptoms of stammering.

<strong><a name="_OtherrecommendationsforTreating_stammering"></a>Other recommendations for Treating Stammering

Stammering is known to be aggravated by fatigue, anxiety or nervousness. A positive environment at home and at workplace is of paramount importance in helping a
person who stammers cure his disorder. Above all, stammering can not be cured overnight. It takes time and patience but the rewards at the end of it all are really worth the time.

<h2><a name="_WhatisLowbloodpressure"></a>What is Low blood pressure/ Hypotension?</h2>
Blood pressure is the force exerted by blood against the walls of arteries. Blood pressure comprises of systolic and diastolic pressures, which are measured in millimeters of mercury or mmHg. Systolic pressure is the blood pressure, when the heart contracts to send blood into the arteries. It ensures a supply of blood around the body. Diastolic pressure is the pressure that continues to be exerted on the arteries between each contraction.

A blood pressure equal to 120/80 or 115/75, is considered normal. However, blood pressure may vary widely for different persons and at different places and time of the day depending on activities.

A fall in the blood pressure below normal reading of 90/60 mm/Hg is generally called low blood pressure or Hypotension. This figure may vary slightly depending on age/ sex and nature of work. In this state the action of heart, which pumps the blood through the arteries is weak due to
devitalized system.

Low blood pressure can be permanent, transitory, occasional or frequent. This is not a disease per se, but rather a symptom.

Consistent low blood pressure can even be a healthy sign. At rest the pressure of normal healthy people tends to lower below normal and is a sign of good cardiovascular health. In low blood pressure there is a reduced risk of developing heart attack, stroke and kidney disease.

Low blood pressure is dangerous, only when it shows a sudden drop, rapid fluctuation or if pressure is so low that it fails to properly propel the blood to all organs. Sudden drop in blood pressure may be accompanied by dizziness, weakness and sometimes fainting. These symptoms usually appear when some one stands quickly after sitting or lying down for a long time. (Orthostatic hypotension)

People of all ages (including healthy young adults) can experience low blood pressure and its allied symptoms.

However, Low blood pressure is most common among people over 65 years of age since blood vessel walls become rigid with aging

Bedridden people are also prone to hypotension because of low level of cardio vascular activities in their body. Similarly pregnant women are also more vulnerable to Hypotension, because of vital hormonal changes in their body.

<ul>
	<li>Drink plenty of water to keep the body hydrated. Dehydration is one of the prime causes of low blood pressure.</li>
	<li>Stay away from hot environment. Heat dilates blood vessels and increases sweating both of which result in lowering of blood pressure. Avoid physical exertion when it gets too hot.</li>
	<li>When getting out of bed or leaving a chair after sitting for a long time, stand up slowly. Sit on the bed side or stretch for 1 minute, before getting down from the bed or the chair.</li>
	<li>Avoid alcohol. Alcohol significantly reduces blood pressure.</li>
	<li>Do not sit or sleep with crossed legs. Crossing legs constricts blood into the lower parts of the body and significantly drops blood pressure.</li>

Uterus or the womb hangs freely in the pelvic cavity. It can move in all directions supported by pelvic tissues and ligaments.

<a name="WhatisUterineProlapse"></a>
<h2>What is Uterine Prolapse?</h2>
Uterine Prolapse (aka uterus displacement/ womb displacement or procidentia) is a condition in which:

1) The pelvic muscles and ligaments that hold the uterus in place start sagging resulting in a downward displacement of the uterus between the bladder and the rectum. (moderate or mild uterine displacement)

2) Tissues are damaged to the extent that Uterus eventually falls in the vaginal canal (Uterovaginal prolapse)

<h2>Possible Complications</h2>
Uterine displacement if not treated timely can have a significant bearing on the quality of life. Urinary incontinence, Inability to conceive and reduced sexual pleasure are the most common fall outs of uterine prolapse.

<a name="UterineProlapsePossiblemodesoftreatment"></a>
<h2>Uterine Prolapse: Possible modes of treatment</h2>
The best way to deal with uterine displacement is the naturopathic course. Surgery may incapacitate the patient for a long period of time, not to mention the pain, risks and expenses involved. Natural Cures may take only a few months to bring considerable relief.

In general, the following course of treatment is followed for curing Uterine Prolapse.

1) Mild prolapse: Pelvic muscle training with specific exercises help prevent uterine prolapse.

2) If uterine prolapse is caused by estrogen deficiency - creams, suppositories and oral medications may be used. In some cases, estrogen-based hormone therapy may be required.

3) If displacement of uterus becomes troublesome, doctors advise surgical interference which involves tying the distended ligaments.

4) Alternatively doctors may fit a pessary to keep the uterus in its right
place. This acts as a palliative but fails to help the muscles resume their lost
strength or former shape.

5) Synthetic prosthesis or pessary treatment may be considered to replace or support the the perinea muscles suspension of the bladder.

6) If uterine prolapse occurs in older women and if it decreases the quality of life of the patients, lablation of the uterus may be considered.

<h2>Exercises for treatment of prolapsed uterus</h2>
Uterine Displacement is a disorder where natural treatment and exercises are very effective in strengthening and toning the tissues that hold the uterus. Pelvic muscles, like any other muscle needs exercise to stay strong.

However, you cannot expect immediate results with exercise. It may take up to 6 months for good results. The more advanced the displacement, the longer the period it takes for recovery.

Exercising also helps eliminate incontinence and reduces the possibilities of pelvic cancer.

<strong>Uterine Prolapse Exercise #1 </strong>Keep a hard pillow under your buttocks, instead of keeping it under your head. Sleeping in this position is perhaps the best and simplest exercise for uterine prolapse as it allows the uterus to return to its former position under the effect of gravity.

This exercise is also suitable for women with protruding abdomen, who might find other exercises to be difficult in the beginning.
<strong>Uterine Prolapse Exercise #2 Kegel</strong><strong> Exercise</strong>: Kegel exercises (named after the doctor who taught them) are very effective in revitalizing the pelvic muscles. Doing Kegel exercises for 10 minutes daily can make a significant difference in correcting the displacement of uterus.

The exercise begins with identifying the pelvic muscles that hold the uterus. To identify the right muscles, start by trying to stop the flow of urine. The muscles that contract to stop urination are the muscles that hold the uterus and they are the ones that need to be toned.

Alternatively, you can locate the pelvic muscles by lying down and inserting a finger into the vagina. Again act as if you are trying to stop urine flow. The muscles that tighten around your finger are the pelvic muscles that need exercising.

For doing this exercise, Lie on the bed, tighten the pelvic muscles, holding for 3-5 seconds. Relax muscles for another 3-5 seconds. Repeat at least 5-7 times in each session and do up to 3 sessions a day.

Try to gradually work your way up to 10-15 repetitions in each session. Keep patience, as it may take weeks or even months before you start noticing difference. Other variants of this exercise involves doing the same practices in sitting and standing posture.

Do not hold your breath or stretch other muscles while doing Kegel exercises. Stretching the wrong muscles can further aggravate stress on the bladder and may do more harm than good. The best way to do this is to imagine that you are trying to stop the natural action of the bladder during urination.
<strong>Uterine Prolapse Exercise #3 </strong>This exercise should be done on empty stomach, preferably in the morning. Lie on your back on the floor and lift your legs alternately without bending your knees. After doing this for about a minute, lift and move both legs as if you are cycling. Do this for about a minute. While still lying, lift your
waist, so that your body arches upwards while your head and heels still remain in contact with the floor. Push your abdomen in an out alternately in that arched position, as you continue to breathe deeply. Repeat this for few minutes.
<strong>Uterine Prolapse Exercise #4 </strong>Lie in the arch position, as stated above in exercise#2. Move your waist to the left and then to the right while maintaining the contact of your head and heels with the ground.
<strong>Uterine Prolapse Exercise #5 </strong>Lie on the floor with face down. Raise your abdomen, while keeping the feet and thighs in contact with the floor. Move your abdomen up and down for around 10 minutes or as long as you feel comfortable.
<strong>Uterine Prolapse Exercise #6 </strong>Lie with your knees touching your breast for as long as you feel comfortable.
<a name="Precautionstopreventprolapseofuterus"></a>

<h2>Precautions to prevent prolapse of uterus</h2>
To prevent prolapse of the uterus:

- Perform household chores in a sitting position.

- Do regular exercises to maintain the tone of pelvic muscles

- After meals, lie down with a pillow under your buttock.

- Keep a tab on body weight. Obese women are more likely to witness uterine prolapse

- Avoid lifting heavy weights as it puts undue pressure on the abdomen.

- Don’t smoke. Smoking tends to aggravate symptoms of prolapse

- Monitor with regular physical pelvic examination using speculum combined with palpation of abdomen and labdomen

- Women above 55 years of age, with a prolapse concern may consider undergoing estrogen replacement therapy (ERT).

<a name="NaturalCuresforUterineprolapse"></a>
<h2>Natural Cure for Uterine Prolapse</h2>
<strong>Bed rest:</strong> Rest is vital for allowing time to the muscles to relax and tone up. Rest is a vital element of natural cure for uterine prolapse. A fortnight of complete bed rest provides relief from allied symptoms of uterine prolapse. Exertions of any kind should be avoided during bed rest.

<strong>Fasting: </strong>Women suffering from uterine displacement might consider fasting on fruit juices for up to three days. Fasting relieves pressure from the abdomen area and spares the pelvic muscles from carrying additional burden. This provides time for revitalization of the pelvic muscles. Fasting also helps clean the body of toxic radicals.

Juice of apples, cherries, dates, pomegranates and beetroot must be be taken during this period. Avoid all other fruits as they inhibit the formation of estrogen. Fasting, can be continued for a longer period of time under the supervision of qualified
naturopaths.

<strong>Epsom salt bath:</strong> Epsom salt is rich in magnesium and sulphates. Magnesium helps ease muscular tension, regulate body enzymes and prevents hardening of tissues. Sulfates help in absorption of essential nutrients and in flushing toxic radicals from the body. Thus Epsom salt bath is effective in revitalizing pelvic muscles. For taking this bath, add about 1-1.5 kg of Epsom salt in warm bathing water. The patient should then immerse his pelvic areas in the water for around twenty minutes.

<strong>Hip/ Sitz Bath: </strong>Hip/ Sitz bath is beneficial in treatment and cure of displaced uterus. For this, the water level in the tub should be up to the navel. Rub your abdomen and other parts immersed in water, vigorously. After coming out of the tub, rub the wet pelvic area with a rough towel.

<strong>Massage of abdomen with Olive oil: </strong>Olive oil has many benefits in treatment of uterine prolapse. For one, it is rich in estrogen and compensates for the loss of estrogen, which is a major cause of displacement of uterus. External application of olive oil, is known to improve blood circulation and thus helps in revitalizing the pelvic tissues.

<h2>Dietary recommendations for treatment of Uterine displacement</h2>
Diet constitutes an important constituent in holistic treatment of uterine prolapse. The following are advised:
<img src="http://home-cure.net/images/papaya.jpg" alt="" width="145" height="97" align="left" border="0" />

<strong>Food high in Estrogen: </strong>Lack of estrogen is the prime cause of uterine displacement, especially in older women. Food rich in estrogen, compensate for this deficiency. This includes eggplant, alfalfa, flaxseeds, aniseed, baker's yeast, pomegranates, parsley, barley, pepper, beets, split peas, cherries, black- eyed peas, cucumber, dates, eggs, fennel, licorice, oats, papaya, green peas, plums, red beans, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and yams.

In general, many leguminous roots are rich in estrogen. A liberal intake of estrogen rich food is very effective natural cure for alleviating and providing relief from symptoms of uterine prolapse.
<img src="http://home-cure.net/images/soymilk.jpg" alt="" width="107" height="105" align="right" border="0" />

<strong>Food rich in Proteins: </strong>Proteins are the building blocks for our body muscles. Pelvic muscles are no exception to this. Food rich in protein provide strength and helps tone up muscles. White egg, Whole grain pastas, Lentils and Soybeans are rich sources of protein. A liberal intake of low fat, protein is effective in treatment and cure of uterine prolapse.
<strong>Minerals for natural treatment of Uterine Prolapse</strong>

The exact role played by different minerals in preventing uterine displacement has not yet been clearly elucidated. However uterine displacement is often associated with deficiency of zinc, magnesium and calcium
<img src="http://home-cure.net/images/sunflowerseeds.jpg" alt="" width="132" height="100" align="left" border="0" />

<strong>Zinc rich food: </strong>Of all the minerals, zinc deficiency is one of the most important nutritional cause of displacement of uterus. Zinc has important attributes which help in regulating enzymes, healing wounds and repair and growth of tissues. Given these attributes, Zinc has been found very effective home cure for uterine prolapse.

Natural sources of Zinc include brewer's yeast, green leafy vegetable, oysters,
pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, Wheat bran. A liberal intake of these foods is effective in alleviating conditions related to uterine displacement.
<img src="http://home-cure.net/images/almonds.jpg" alt="" width="144" height="126" align="right" border="0" />

<strong>Magnesium rich food: </strong>Magnesium has essential attributes which relieves muscular tension and helps maintain muscular tonality. Deficiency of magnesium is known to cause muscle rigidity, which is a prime cause of uterine prolapse. Food rich in Magnesium include apples , soybeans, nuts, green leafy vegetables, peaches and almonds. Intake of these foods help address magnesium deficiency and is helpful in treatment of uterine prolapse.
<img src="http://home-cure.net/images/seseameseed.jpg" alt="" width="156" height="120" align="left" border="0" />

<strong>Calcium rich food: </strong>Calcium is needed for bone and tooth formation and muscle contraction. Calcium also aids in absorption of magnesium, which is so very vital for maintaining the desired tonality of pelvic muscles. An adult requires a daily intake of 10grams of calcium. Normal Staple food is naturally deficient in providing for this requirement. Food rich in Calcium includes Milk, Yoghurt, almonds, dark leafy vegetables, oats, sesame seeds, millet, navy beans, sunflower seeds and canned salmon/sardines. Excess calcium however, interferes with absorption of zinc in the body and should thus be taken in moderate quantities.

<a name="FoodstoAvoidinUterineProlapse"></a>

<h2><a name="HairLossWhenisitacauseofworry"></a>Hair Loss: When is it a cause of worry?</h2>
Person with a healthy scalp loses an average of 40-80 (sometimes less) hairs a day. This is a natural process as each hair goes through a life cycle, at the end of which the follicle dies only to be replaced by new hair.

Each hair goes through a life cycle, which may vary from person to person or even for each hair of one person. A hair might go through one or all of these phases during its life;

a) Growth phase: During this phase, hair is linked to follicle. This phase usually lasts for about three to seven years before the hair falls off and is replaced by new follicle.

        <title>Weakness after Urination</title>
        <link>http://home-cure.net/weakness-after-urination/</link>
        <guid>549</guid>
        <content><![CDATA[<strong>Causes, precautions and natural cures for treatment of weakness after urination</strong>
<img src="http://home-cure.net/images/weak.jpg" alt="" width="91" height="122" align="right" border="0" />Urination is a voluntarily act which is controlled by the higher cortical function in the brain. This complex neurological system is a functional synergy amongst the brain, kidney, urinary bladder and sphincters.

Besides being voluntary, it can can also be triggered or inhibited at will. Unfortunately, this complex mechanism is fragile and slight hormonal or physical disturbances can disturb the entire urinary process and result in urinary disorders like incontinence, pain and weakness.
<h2>Causes of weakness after urination</h2>
Weakness may result from one or more of the following causes:

1) Weakened immunity

2) Electrolytic Imbalance

3) Digestive disorder

4) Not drinking enough water

5) Disorder of the urinary tract

6) Nutritional deficiency

7) Symptom of diabetes

&nbsp;
<h2>Precautions for treatment of weakness after urination:</h2>
1) In case you witness weakness after urination, a thorough urine examination is advised. It could be a symptom of diabetes which requires timely medical intervention.

2) Drink plenty of water. This will keep the body hydrated and will remove harmful toxins from the body. Drinking water should be evenly spread over the entire day and should not be consumed at once, as it could lead to hyper hydration or water poisoning.

3) Fasting on fruit juice for 2-3 days is recommended, as it helps improve body immunity. Juice of carrot,
papaya, orange, beetroot and other citrus fruits must be taken during fasting.

4) Weakness could also be caused by electrolytic imbalance in the body which generally occur after urination. Add one teaspoon of sugar and a pinch of salt to a glass of water and drink it up to twice a day to correct imbalances.

&nbsp;
<h2>Diet for treatment of weakness after urination</h2>
Weakness can be caused by deficiency of essential vitamins, proteins and minerals in the body. The following dietary changes are suggested:

<strong>Diet rich in Vitamin C: </strong>Vitamin C helps the body absorb bioflavonoid, which help in cleaning the body of toxic radicals. This helps address weakness and improve body immunity. An adult requires at least 2000 milligrams of vitamin C intake during the day. Staple food normally fails in providing for this.

Include food like lemon, oranges, dried basil, fortified cereals, parsley, raw Brussels sprouts, sun dried tomato, dry rosemary, broccoli and dry coriander to address possible deficiency of Vitamin C in the body.

<strong>Essential Minerals: </strong>Deficiency of magnesium, calcium, zinc and selenium are
often associated with weakness and fatigue felt after urination. Supplements of essential minerals can also be taken.

<strong>Foods to avoid</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Food rich in refined sugar including candies, chocolates</li>
	<li>Food made of white flour</li>
	<li>Tea, Coffee and Alcohol</li>
	<li>Canned and tinned food</li>
	<li>Any devitalizing food</li>
</ul>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>

<strong>Weakness after urination</strong> is a symptom of diabetes and should not be taken lightly. Consult a doctor for a through diagnosis based on Urine examination.<strong> </strong>Clinical examination might as well look into neurological, prostrate and perinea related causes of weakness.]]></content>

Unhygienic conditions of genitals make them prone to bacterial infections and other kinds of infections. Vaginitis may occur during menstruation period, due to thickening of mucous membrane.
<h2><a name="IsitLeucorrhoea"></a>Is it Leucorrhoea?</h2>
Vaginal discharge is the main symptom of leucorrhoea. However not all vaginal discharge is leucorrhoea.

Vaginal discharge may occur due to general factors such as pregnancy, excessive vaginal ovulation during menstruation or menopause. Normally such secretions are cyclic and regular occurrence.

<h2>What are kidney stones?</h2>
Stones form in the kidney, because of crystallization of some minerals or chemicals like calcium or uric acid which do not get discharged in the urine.  Gradually the deposits grow larger and become a cause of concern. If the stones are larger than 2-3mm in size, they can get blocked in ureter. This blocks the  urine flow  and causes serious problems.  When the stone is not  small  enough to pass through the ureter, it blocks the tube. In the absence of proper discharge of waste, it causes complications and pain in the area.

If the stones form in urinary tract, it is called urolithiasis, if the stones form in the kidneys, it is called nephrolithiasis and if the stones form in ureter, it is called ureterolithiasis.


<h2>Types of kidney stones</h2>


There are four types of kidney stones:

<strong>Calcium oxalate kidney stones: </strong>They are usually formed by the waste deposits of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate that doesn’t get dissolved. They have a coating of altered blood and have hard , rough and spiky appearance.

<strong>Uric acid kidney stones: </strong>They are formed due to high uric acid content  in the  urine. Excessive intake of foods rich in animal protein may cause the high uric acid content the urine. The urine may be constantly acidic and this leads to uric acid stones. They are brown in color and have a laminated appearance.

<strong>Phosphate stones: </strong>They mingle with oxalate and they are soft and chalky in appearance.

<strong>Struvite stones: </strong>They   occur due to infections in the kidney.

		<h2><strong>What is Jaundice?</strong></h2>
Jaundice is a very common liver disorder characterized by hyper-destruction of red blood cells, and/or failure of liver to synthesize these RBC at a matching rate. Jaundice occurs due to increase in the bile pigments (bilirubin) in the blood.

Haemoglobin present in red blood cells is the main carriers of oxygen throughout the body. Red blood cells are produced continuously in the bone marrow.The red blood cells have a lifespan of around 120 days during which it passes through the blood. After 120 days, RBC is destructed in the spleen. This destruction results in the normal release of free bilirubin which is toxic. Free bilirubin then reaches the liver where biochemical processes transform it into non-toxic bilirubin which then forms a component of bile. This bilirubin is responsible for the yellow color of urine and feces.

The amount of bilirubin increases very fast, when red blood cells die rapidly. Liver fails to convert it into bile at a matching pace. This results in a yellow discoloration of the skin and mucus membranes which is called Jaundice.

Another instance of Jaundice occurs when the hemolysis is normal but the functioning of liver is affected due to some diseases like Infection resulting in hepatitis or enzymes imbalance which prevents the level from normally synthesizing bilirubin.

Still another situation in which jaundice occurs involves presence an some obstacle to the flow of bile causing a retention of synthesized bilirubin. This bilirubin enters the bloodstream in excess of the required proportion and results in jaundice called "cholestasis"

        <title>Bad Breath (Halitosis)</title>
        <link>http://home-cure.net/home-remedies-bad-breath/</link>
        <guid>887</guid>
        <content><![CDATA[<img class="alignright" title="bad-breath" src="http://home-cure.net/images/badbreath.jpg" alt="bad-breath" width="176" height="135" />
<strong><a name="BadbreathWhenisittoobad">Bad breath:When is it too bad ?</a></strong>

Bad breath, technically known as halitosis is a concern for more than 40% of the world population. 

Bad breath may be temporary as in case of morning halitosis. Bad breath in morning is generally temporary and is caused due to intake of sulphide rich foods and administration of certain drugs.It occurs because breathing at night dries up the mouth. Dried membranes cause anaerobic bacteria to proliferate during the night which results in bad breath. This bad breath disappears after washing and brushing in the morning. Such transient halitosis is not a cause of worry and is not to be treated.

A  chronic bad breath is what needs intervention.

Though a benign condition with no pain, halitosis causes embarrassment, affects relationships and can have distressing psychological consequences.

<strong><a name="HowtocheckifyouhaveaBadBreath">How to check if you have a Bad Breath?</a></strong>

Smelling ones own breath is almost impossible. You nose cannot perceive even the most foul smells emitted from your mouth. This is because our nose can only detect changes in smell and not the smell in itself. It cannot detect those odors in which you are persistently bathed.

Some people try to smell their own breath by exhaling and covering their mouth with their palm. Though this can give some idea, it will not give you the exact nature of your mouth’s smell.

How then to check if your mouth omits foul smell? One can ask a dentist or someone who can be relied upon to give an objective opinion. Another solution would be to scratch the back of your tongue with a tongue cleaner and sniff it for odour, if any.


<strong><a name="CausesofBadBreath">Causes of Bad Breath</a></strong>

Halitosis can have different causes. These are:

<strong>Oral disorders: </strong>Oral disorders like<strong> </strong>caries, pyorrhoea, plaque, gingivitis, tooth decay, abscess, mouth ulcer and other periodontal disease are often associated with bad breath. Consult a dentist if you want to get rid of bad breath and suffer from any of these oral disorders.

<strong>Sulphide:  </strong>This is the most common cause of bad breath. Compounds of Sulphide have a characteristic pungent odour resembling that of rotten eggs. They are volatile, in sense; they can easily evaporate leaving behind pungent odour. Sulphides are produced in our mouth by anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that thrive without oxygen) even in healthy mouths. However when these bacteria multiply in large amount, the odour becomes marked. Intake of food rich in sulphide such as onions, garlic and some strong spices cause bad breath.

<strong>Protein rich food: </strong>Anaerobic bacteria thrive on protein residue leftover in mouth and produce sulphide which promotes bad breath. Avoid eating food rich in protein like meat (beef, chicken, turkey, tuna, salmon), nuts (almonds, avocados, peanut) and beans (soybeans, lentils etc.)

<strong>ENT disorders: </strong>Bad breath can be a warning signal for an underlying ENT disorder like simple cold, stuffy nose, dried mucous cough, sinusitis and chronic tonsillitis.  These ENT disorders cause dried mucous discharge at the back of the throat which is a common cause of bad breath.

<strong>Lung disorders: </strong>Infection of Lung and related disorders like bronchitis and bronchiectasis also result in bad breath.

<strong>Digestive disorders:</strong> Gastro- intestinal disorders, intestinal sluggishness and chronic constipation also result in bad breath.

<strong>Tobacco &amp; Alcohol:</strong> Smoking, Alcohol and consumption of other tobacco products is associated with gum disease and bad breath. Smoking and alcohol dries up the mouth and the mucous membranes. This makes it more prone to bacterial infection which further aggravates bad breath.

<strong>Other Causes:</strong> Certain drugs like anti-histamines, anti allergic, anti depressants and diuretics result in drying of the mucous membrane and cause bad breath. Stress induces dryness in mouth and can also cause bad breath.

<strong><a name="HalitosisPossibleComplications">Halitosis: Possible Complications</a></strong>

Bad breath is often a symptom of some other health disorder. It is a warning signal take a close look at ones habits and lifestyle.

Halitosis per se is a benign condition. However don’t let the banality of the disorder ignore its potential risk factors.

Bad breath if left untreated for the root causes could signal disorders like oral cavity, dental caries, diabetes and pyorrhoea. Poor oral hygiene in rare cases is also associated with increased risk of cancer, kidney and liver disorders.

		
		Treatment of Halitosis must begin a review of oral hygiene. More often than not, halitosis is caused by poor dental hygiene which may result in tooth decay, gum disease, throat and nose conditions and respiratory track problems. Even small holes in teeth may provide space for germs to multiply and release foul smell.

<strong>External Examination: </strong>Use a directed source of light to examine the ear canal for possible foreign bodies like large dust particles, hair, moths or large chunks of solidified wax. Light is very effective in attracting and driving out moths that could have possibly got stuck in the canal. If other obstructions are noticed, use ear buds soaked in olive oil to push out the irritant.

<strong>Chew, Swallow and Yawn</strong>: Strange as it may seem, the act of chewing, swallowing and yawning are very effective in relief from Infection of inner ear. These acts help in clearing congestions in the eustachian tubes. Keep swallowing your saliva or drink some juice or water.

For better results, make the process of swallowing, chewing or yawning as comical as possible.

Applying heat externally around ears is effective in relieving earache caused due to swimmers ear. Place a heating pad (set to medium heat) or a heated water bottle around the sore areas. You can also use hair dryer (set to minimum). Hold the hair dryer round 20cm away from the ear and direct hot air into the ear canal. This often provides temporary relief from pain.

<strong>Antibiotics: </strong>Antibiotics are especially effective in treatment of earache caused due to bacterial infection. Antibiotic ear drops are very effective in arresting ear infection and relieving earache. Consult a doctor before taking antibiotic medicines. Basil leaves; garlic, cloudberry, marigold, bishop’s weed and margosa leaves are some of the most potent, no side-effect natural anti bacterial antibiotics. These natural alternatives may be used to treat bacterial infection for relief from earache. Painkillers (analgesics) may additionally be taken for temporary relief for earache <strong></strong>

<strong>General Precautions: </strong>Do not clean ear wax regularly. Wax serves an important purpose of protecting and lubricating vital parts of the ear. Regular cleaning makes the ear canal more prone to bacterial attack. Milled rice, sugar and lentils promote production of phlegm in the body. Avoid them.
		Delays in treatment of ear infection can cause irreversible damages. If earache does not reduce beyond 24 hours of self-treatment, immediately consult a doctor. You must consult a ENT specialist if;

        <content><![CDATA[
		Dysentery is a serious condition which affects the large intestine. It results in inflammation and ulceration of the lower portion of the bowels. It is prevalent all over the world. In places where the sanitary conditions are not well maintained, more such cases are found. This disease affects both sexes equally. Children are more prone to this disease.

The pathological condition of dysentery is caused by two organisms. They are protozoa and bacilli. Dysentery caused by protozoa is called amoebic dysentery. Dysentery caused by bacilli is called bacillary dysentery. Amoebic dysentery is milder than bacillary dysentery.  Bacillary dysentery can be got rid of quickly through medication. But amoebic dysentery takes a long time to get cured.

<strong>Causes of Dysentery</strong>

Microbial infection is the main cause of dysentery. Consuming food contaminated by bacteria and germs cause dysentery. These germs develop in the colon. This   often happens,   as a result of putrefaction of excess quantities of animal food, fatty and fried foods.

Other causes are fatigue, chill, debility, intestinal disorders and unsanitary conditions.

<strong>Symptoms of Dysentery</strong>

Dysentery may be acute and chronic.
<ul>
	<li>In acute form there is pain in the abdomen, diarrhoea   and dysenteric motions.</li>
	<li>Yellowish white mucus passes with the stools.  Sometimes only blood from the intestinal ulcers passes with the stools.</li>
	<li>Pain before the evacuation.</li>
	<li>The desire to evacuate frequently. Even though there may be nothing to throw out, except a little mucus and blood.</li>
	<li>Pain in the rectum and large intestine.</li>
	<li>Fever may rise to 105 F in severe cases</li>
</ul>
With the advance of the disease the blood and mucus quantity increases.
<ul>
	<li>Sometimes shreds of mucous membrane also pass out through motions.</li>
	<li>Sometimes pus also passes out through the motions, which makes it smelly</li>
	<li>The saliva becomes acidic than alkaline</li>
	<li>Stomach loses the power to absorb and digest food.</li>

Arteriosclerosis is usually preceded by atherosclerosis, which is a kind of fatty infiltration in the inner lining of the blood vessel walls. The most prone places are coronary vessels of the heart and the arteries of the brain. Arteriosclerosis results in loss of elasticity of the blood vessels and narrowing of the arteries. This blocks or interferes with the free circulation of the blood.

<ul>
	<li>If there is a blockage of  arteries due to blood clot  , then there may be a cerebral vascular stroke, with partial or complete paralysis on one side of the body.</li>
	<li>It  may lead to loss of memory  or a confused state of mind  in elderly people.</li>
</ul>
If the arteries to the kidney is affected then, the person may suffer from kidney problems and high blood pressure.

		Arthritis means inflammation of the joint. The word is derived from greek words : athron, which means joints; and itis  meaning inflammation. It is a chronic disease  process.

There are over a hundred forms of arthritis. It can be classified into three main categories which may be, rheumatoid arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Gout.

Rheumatoid arthritis normally affects, knees, toes , small finger joints, wrists . All parts of the body can be a target.

Osteoarthritis can affect any joint , but commonly occurs on knees, spine , hips and  feet.

Gout usually occur in  lower limbs and first target the big toes.

Arthritis can  affect both men and women of all age groups. However, women are three times more vulnerable than men. About 80% of rheumatoid arthritis patients are within  age group  of 35 to 50.  About 65% of osteoarthritis patients are over the age of 65.
<h2>Symptoms   common to all forms of arthritis are:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Swelling</li>
	<li>Stiffness and pain</li>
	<li>Redness</li>
</ul>
The pain increases after exercise.

Rheumatoid arthritis is also called ‘cooked food disease’. it normally develops gradually over several months and there is a persistent pain and stiffness in  one or more joints. Ultimately, the whole body is affected.

Symptoms are: Anaemia , constipation, colitis and defamed  hands and feet.
<h2> Causes of arthritis are:</h2>
Arthritis is a result of  damage to joint parts. The causes of arthritis may vary , but  the most common causes are:  hereditary , age, infections, deficiency of organic sodium  and minerals,  mental  or physical strain, obesity, cold weather,  excessive use of rich foods.

Different arthritis is caused due to damage to different parts of the joint.

Gout is caused  by abnormal production of uric acid. When the body produces excess uric acid , it get deposited in the form of needle like crystals  in the joints  instead being excreted  through the urine. These crystals cause friction  and severe pain in the joints when moved.

Rheumatoid arthritis  sets off  when the synovial membrane ( this helps the smooth movement of the joints) becomes inflamed and stiff. Construction workers, dancers, ballerinas  and weight lifters  are often its victims due to high strain on the joints in these professions.

Osteoarthritis  involves damage  and wear and tear  to the cartilage . normally age and  genetic are factors in break down of  the cartilage. Almost every one over the age of sixty suffer from  this form of arthritis to some extent.

The body should be kept warm at all times. Joints should not be bandaged tightly as it restricts the movement and interferes with the free circulation of blood. The  bedroom should have plenty of indirect ventilation. Rest is very important in acute inflammation in the joints.

Sea bathing is effective in arthritis. The natural iodine in sea water relieves arthritis pain. Iodine regulates the acid-alkaline balance in the blood and tissues . This helps in repairing and regenerating worn out tissues and nourishes the skeletal structure. It enters  into the thyroid gland’s secretion. The  hormone uses iodine  to cleanse the internal toxins.

If sea bathing is not possible , the patient should relax for thirty minutes every night in a tub of warm water, in which a cup of common salt has been mixed. The minerals in the salt , especially iodine, will be absorbed through the pores of the skin.
